Hey, Welcome to my first ever blog on this newly created website. I have been thinking lately about creating a personal website including a blog feature with the help of Github-Pages, a website hosting service and Jekyll, a powerful static website generator.
Finally, I have managed some time to do this during the Corona Pandemic. Still there is a lot of improvement to make on this site. The thing is, it's really important to get started something. If you find a flow to it, then anything can be populated, enhanced and fully functional over the time.

With this soft launching of this site, I want to let you know that I am going to start writing blogs on different issues whenever I get time. The next blog will be surely of how I created this site with __github and Jekyll__. I will describe the whole thing from the start to the end by writing each step so that you can have the clear idea about this.
So, Guys please check out the site soon.

See you laterâ€”__ciao!__
