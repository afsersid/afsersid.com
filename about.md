Well, I am currently living with my family in Canada. I am a very tech-savvy person, spending ample time with computers. I developed a huge interest in information security, different programming languages, and frameworks over the years. Apart from these, I watch a lot of movies, TV series, and YouTube videos and read newspaper articles.
